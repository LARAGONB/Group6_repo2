Likewise, people traveling in first class had a better chance of survival than those in second and third class. British passengers were more likely to perish than members of other nations.},

	abstract = {Dawson (1995) described a dataset giving population at risk and fatalities for an unusual mortality episode (the sinking of the ocean liner Titanic), and discussed experiences in using the dataset in an introductory statistics course. In this paper the same dataset is analyzed from the point of view of the second statistics course. A combination of exploratory analysis using tables of observed survival percentages, model building using logistic regression, and careful thought allows the statistician (and student) to get to the essence of the random process described by the data. The well-known nature of the episode gives the students a chance at determining its character, and the data are complex enough to require sophisticated modeling methods to get at the truth.},

	abstract = {A certain dataset, giving population at risk and fatalities for "an unusual episode," has been used for some time in classrooms as an elementary exercise in statistical thinking, the challenge being to deduce the context of the data. Unfortunately, the "solution" has frequently been circulated orally, with few details. Moreover, discrepancies have been found between the dataset and the "solution," which would render the exercise somewhat artificial. This paper investigates the discrepancies and includes a fullyexplained version of the dataset for classroom use.},
